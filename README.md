# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They are distributed by [rcm][1].

The `suckless` folder is special because it does not really contain actual
dotfiles but rather custom builds of suckless (and other) programs. (At the
moment it also contains other programs I install from source but didn't change
the code.)

**NOTE:** When I started this repo I made the mistake to include personal /
private information in some places. I didn't want to make it even worse with
`git rebase` or the like and decided to keep all old history private but
publish the repository without the old commits. For some files that's not too
bad but for example my dwm patch history is obviously lost.
